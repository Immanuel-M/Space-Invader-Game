# üëæ  Space Invaders (Python + Pygame)

### What‚Äôs This?
Remember those arcade cabinets that ate your quarters growing up?  
I rebuilt that vibe in Python. Move the tiny ship, blast the bad guys, chase a high score‚Äîsimple, sweaty-palms fun.

---

## Why I Built It
I wanted a quick way to flex loops, collision logic, and real-time input without drowning in a full game engine. Pygame let me keep it scrappy, stay in pure Python, and still get pixels flying.

---

## Quick-Start
1. Clone the repo  
2. `pip install pygame`  
3. `python space_invaders.py`  
Boom‚Äîgame window pops and you‚Äôre dodging lasers.

### Controls
| Key            | Action            |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| ‚Üê / ‚Üí arrows   | Slide the ship    |
| **Spacebar**   | Pew-pew (shoot)   |

## Under the Hood
* **Python 3.x + Pygame**  
* One game loop, 60 FPS target  
* Basic sprite class for player, enemies, bullets  
* Rect-based collision (keepin‚Äô it light)

---

## Lessons & Next Steps
* Wrangled real-time input without spaghetti code  
* Practiced sprite groups / collision checks  
* Next up? Sound FX, power-ups, and maybe a tiny boss fight‚Äîbecause why not.
